      <p style="text-align:center">The plot of the play revolves around a story that brings forth the themes of Religious virtues like love and redemption. The play dramatically depicts how the love and the compassion of the Bishop brought about a change of heart in a convict and turned him into a man of promise for a good life. The Bishop was a kind-hearted man who being a true Christian was also an ardent humanist. He was ready to sacrifice everything to help the needy people. Even after selling all, he had, for others, he felt sorry that he could do so little whereas the world had so much suffering. He sold his saltcellars and gave the money to Mere Gringoire so that the latter might pay his rent to the bailiff. His sister. Persome was how ever a worldly woman, neither as self-less as her brother nor so noble. She did not like her brother to live for others and not for himself. She thought that people took an unfair advantage of his charitable nature. But the Bishop thought that if the people pretended to be in distressed and deceived him, then they are the poorer in spirit and not he. His door was never shut and it was opened for everybody. One night when the Bishop was about to go to bed, a convict entered the house. At the point of his knife he demanded food from the Bishop. The Bishop was unruffled. He called Persome and asked her to give some supper to the convict. The convict wondered why the Bishop kept his doors and windows open and whether or not he was afraid of thieves and robbers. The Bishop told them that he was not afraid but that he was sorry for them, as they were only poor sufferers. He treated the convict with all love and respect as he regarded him too as a sufferer. He regarded him as a fellowman and a friend. His attitude had some effect on the convict. If we treat a man as a beast, then he becomes a beast. If we treat a beast as a man then it becomes a man. A man is what we think him to be. The convict told the Bishop how he was caught by the police while he stole some food for his ill and starving wife. He was caught and sentenced to ten years in prison. The authorities did not pat any heed to the fact that he had stolen only to feed his ill and starving wife, Jeanette. They regarded him as a born criminal and treated him like a beast for ten years. Then one day he escaped but the society treated him no better. As he was a prisoner, nobody would give him any job. The police hunted him down. He was running away from them starving. So he stole again for food. Thus, society with its wrong attitude, did not give him a chance to lead a good life.
